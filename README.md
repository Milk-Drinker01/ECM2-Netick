# ECM2-Netick
 A project showing how to use ECM2 with Netick

Requirements:
- ECM2 ([link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/easy-character-movement-2-193614))
- Netick 2 Networking Engine ([link](https://discord.gg/hYczyr43vK))

The character movement code is the same as the networked demo included in ECM2.

Use the included CharacterMovementNetick.cs instead of CharacterMovement.cs for Sandbox functionality.
